TRANSLA TJONS.

Wz'tclz-elms that counterclzange the floor.

WITCH-ELMS that counterchange the floor
Of this flat lawn with dusk and bright;
And thou, with all thy breadth and height

Of foliage, towering sycamore;

How often, hither wandering down,
My Arthur found your shadows fair,
And shook to all the liberal air

The dust and din and steam of town:
