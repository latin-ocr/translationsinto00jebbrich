TIMON.

YET thanks I must you con,

That you are thieves profess'd‚ that you work not

In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft

In limited professionS. Rascal thieveS‚

Here’s gold. Go, suck the subtle blood 0' the grape,
Till the high sever seethe your blood to froth‚

And so 'scapo hanging; trust not the physician;

His antidotes are poison, and he slays

More than you· rob; take wealth and lives together;

Do vissany, do, since you protest to do’t,
