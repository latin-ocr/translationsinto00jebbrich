TRANSLA TIONS.

STANZAS.

IN a drear-nighted December,

Too happy, happy tree,

Thy branches ne’er remember

Their green felicity3

The north cannot undo them,

With a sleety whistle through them,
Nor frozen thawings glue them

From budding at the prime.

In a drear-nighted December,

Too happy, happy brook‚
Thy bubblings ne’er remember

Apollo’s summer-look ;
