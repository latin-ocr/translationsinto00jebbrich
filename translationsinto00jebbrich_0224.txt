INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS
OF EARLY CHILDHOOD.

1.

THERE was a time when meadOW‚ grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight,
To me did seem
Apparelled in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hafch been of yore;
Turn wheresoe'er I may,
By night or day,
The things which I have seen Ι now can see no more.
