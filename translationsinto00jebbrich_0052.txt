TRANSLA TIONS.

As when a mighty people rejoice

With shawms and with cymbals, and harps of gold,
And the tumult of their acclaim is roll’d

Thro’ the open gates of the city afar,

To the Shepherd who watcheth the evening star.
And the creeping mosses and clambering weeds,
And the willow-branches hoar and dank,

And the wavy swell of the soughing reeds,
And the wave-worn horns of the echoing bank,
And the silvery marish-flowers that throng

The desolate creeks and pools among,

Were flooded over with eddying song.

TENNYSON.
