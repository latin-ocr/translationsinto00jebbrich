TITHONUS.

THE woods decay, the woods decay and fall,

The vapours weep their burthen to the ground,
Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath,
And after many a summer dies the swan.

Me only cruel immortality

Consumes: I wither slowly in thine arms,

Here at the quiet limit of the world,

A white-hair’d shadow roaming like a dream
The ever silent spaces of the East,

Far-folded mistS‚ and gleaming halls of morn.
