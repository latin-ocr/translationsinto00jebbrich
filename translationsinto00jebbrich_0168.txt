152 TRANSLA TIONS.

Her suffim'ngs ended wz'tlc the day.

HER sufferings ended with the day;
Yet lived she at its close,
And breathed the long, long night away

In statue-like repose.

But when the sun in all his state
Illumed the eastern skies,

She passed through glory’s morning gate
And walked in Paradise.

JAMEs ALDRICH.
