So honour cross it from the north to south,
And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
Imagination of some great exploit

Drives him beyond the bounds os patience.

By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap

To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,

Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;

So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
Without corrival all her dignities:

But out upon this half—faced fellowship!

SHAKESPEARE.
