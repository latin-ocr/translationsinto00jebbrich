, 14 TRANSLA TJONS.

Well, it is earth with me ; silence resumes her reign:
I will be patient and proud, and soberly acquiesce.
Give me the keys. Ι feel for the common chord again,
Sliding by semitones, till I sink to the minor‚—-yes,
And I blunt it into a ninth, and I stand on alien ground,
Surveying awhile the heights I rolled from into the deep;
Which, hark, Ι have dared and done, for my resting-place
is found,
The C Major of this life: so, now I will try to sleep.

BROWNJNG.
