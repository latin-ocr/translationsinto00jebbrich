1 hear, Ι hear, with joy I hear!
——But there’s a Tree, of many, one,
A single Field which Ι have looked upon,
Both of them speak of something that is gone:
The pansy at my feet
Doth the same tale repeat:
Whither is spread the visionary gleam?

⁸ Where is it now, the glory and the dream?

V.

Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
The Soul that rises with US‚ our life’s Star,
Hath had elsewhere its setting,

And cometh from afar:

Not in entire forgetfulness,
And not in utter nakedness‚

But trailing clouds of glory do we come

From God, who is our home:

Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
