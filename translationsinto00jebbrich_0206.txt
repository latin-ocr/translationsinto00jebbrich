190 TRANSLA TJONS.

Nature that heard such sound‚
Beneath the hollow round

Of Cynthia's seat, the airy region thrilling,
Now was almost won

To think her part was done,

And that her reign had here its last fulfilling;

She knew such harmony alone

Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union.

At last surrounds their sight

A globe of circular light,

That with long bearns the shamefaced night arrayed;
The helmed cherubim,
And sworded seraphim,

Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed,
Harping in loud and solemn quire,

With unexpressive notes to Heaven’s new-born Heir.
