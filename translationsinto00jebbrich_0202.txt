186 TRANSLA TJONS.

 

The stars with deep amaze
Stand fixed in stedfast gaze,

Bending one way their precious influence,
And will not take their ssight,
For all the morning light,

Or Lucifer that often warned them thence;
But in their glimmering orbs did glow,

Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.

And though the shady gloom
Had given day her room,
The sun himself withheld his wonted speed,

And hid his head for shame,
As his inferior flame

The new enlightened world no more should need;
He saw a greater Sun appear

Than his bright throne, or burning axletree‚ could bear.
