228 TRANSLA TIONS.

What though the radiance which was once so bright
Be now for ever taken from my sight,
Though nothing can bring back the hour

Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the fiower;

We will grieve not, rather find

Strength in what remains behind;

In the primal sympathy

Which having been must ever be ;

In the soothing thoughts that spring

Out of human suffering;

In the saith that looks through death,

In years that bring the philosophie mind.

XI.

And O, ye Fountains‚ Meadows‚ Hills, and> Groves,

F orebode not any severing of our loves!

Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;

I only have relinquished one delight
