66 TRANSLA TIONS.

Many a year is z‘n z‘ts graver

MANv a year is in its grave

Since I cross'd this restless wave;

And the evening, fair as ever,

Shines on ruin, rock and river.

Then in this same boat beside,
Sat two comrades, old and tried ;·
One, with all a father's truth ;

One, with all the fire of youth.
