ABT VOGLER.

WOULD that the structure brave, the manifold music I build,
Bidding my organ obey, calling its keys to their work,
Claiming each slave of the sound‚ at a touch, as when

Solomon willed
Armies of angels that soar, legions of demons that lurk,
Man, brute, reptile, fly‚-alien of end and of aim,
Adverse, each from the other heaven-high, hell-deep re-
moved,—
Should rush into sight at once as he named the ineffable
N ame,

And pile him a palace straight, to pleasure the princess
he lovecl!
