THE DREAM.

A CHANGE came o'er the spirit of my dream.
The Boy was sprung to manhood: in the wilds
Of fiery elimes he made himself a home,

And his soul drank theIr sunbeams: he was girt
With strange and dusky aspeets: he was not
Himself like what he had been; on the sea
And on the shore he was a wanderer ;

There was a mass of many images
