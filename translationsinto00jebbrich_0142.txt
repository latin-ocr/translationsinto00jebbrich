THE LAST MAN.

ALL worldly shapes shall melt in gloom,
The Sun himself must die,

Before this mortal shall assume
Its Immortality!

1 saw a vision in my sleep‚

That gave my spirit strength to sweep
Adown the gulf of Time!

1 saw the last of human mould,

That shall Creation’s death behold,

As Adam saw her prime!
