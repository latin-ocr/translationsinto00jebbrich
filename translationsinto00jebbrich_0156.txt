THE PROGRESS OF POESY.

YOUTH rambles on life’s arid mount,
And strikes the rock‚ and finds the vein,
And brings the water from the fount‚

The fount which shall not flow again.

The man mature with labour chops

For the bright stream a channe] grand,

And sees not that the sacred drops

Ran off and vanished out of hand.
