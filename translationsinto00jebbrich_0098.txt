TRANSLA TJONS.

ASIA.

HE gave men speech, and speech created thought,
Which is the measure of the universe3

And Science struck the thrones of earth and heaven,
Which shook, but fell not; and the harmonious mind
Pour'd itself forth in all-prophetie song;

And music lifted up the listening spirit

Until it walk'd, exempt from mortal care,

Godlike, o’er the clear billows of sweet sound;

And human hands first mimick'd and then moeked,

With moulded limbs more lovely than its own,
