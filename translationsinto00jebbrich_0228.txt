And all the earth is gay;

Land and sea
Give themselves up to jollity‚

And with the heart of May
Doth every beast keep holiday3—
‚ Thou Child of Joy,
Shout round me, let 'me hear thy shoutS‚ thou
happy Shepherd-boy!

Ye blessed Creatures, Ι have heard the call
Ye to each other make3 I see
The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
My heart is at your festival,
My head hath its coronal,
The fulness of your bliss, I feel—I feel it all.
Oh evil day! if I were sullen
While Earth herself is adorning,
This sweet May-morning,
And the Children are culling
' On every side,
In a thousand valleys far and wide,
Fresh fiowers; while the sun shines warm,

And the Babe leaps up on his Mother’s arm 2—-
