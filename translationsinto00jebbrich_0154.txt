138 TRANSLA TJONS.

Who from the terror of this arm so late
Doubted his empire 3 that were low indeed,
That were an ignominy and shame beneath

This downfallÍ¾ since, by fate, the strength of gods,

And this empyreal substance, cannot fail:
Since, through experience of this great event,
In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,
We may with more successful hope resolve

To wage by force or guile eternal war,
Irreconcileable to our grand foe,

Who now triumphs, and in the excess of joy
Sole reigning holds the tyranny of heaven.
