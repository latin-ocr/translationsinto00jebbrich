4 . TRANSLA TJONS.

Would it might tarry like his, the beautiful building of mine,
This which my keys in a crowd pressed and importuned
to raise!
Ah, one and all, how they helped, would dispart now and
now combine, ’
Zealous to hasten the work, heighten their master his praise!
And one would bury his brow with a blind plunge down
to hell,
Burrow awhile and build, broad on the roots of things,
Then up again swim into sight, having based me my
palace well,
Founded it, fearless of flame, flat on the nether springs,

And another would mount and march, like the excellent
minion he was,
Ay, another and yet another, one crowd but with many
a erest,
Raising my rampired walls of gold as transparent as glass,
Eager to do and die, yield each his place to the rest:
For higher still and higher (as a runner tips with fire,
When a great illumination surprises a festal night—
Outlining round and round Rome’s dome from space to spire)
Up‚ the pinnacled glory reached, and the pride of my

soul was in sight.
