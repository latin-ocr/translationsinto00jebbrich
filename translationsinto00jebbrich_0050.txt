TRANSLA TIONS.

THE DYING SWAN.

THE wild swan’s death-hymn took the soul
Of that waste place with joy

Hidden in sorrow: at first to the ear
The warble was low, and full and clear;
And floating about the under sky,
Prevailing in weakness‚ the coronach stole

Sometimes afar, and sometimes anear5
But anon her awful jubilant voice,
With a music strange ancl manifold‚

Flow’d forth on a carol free and b01d;
