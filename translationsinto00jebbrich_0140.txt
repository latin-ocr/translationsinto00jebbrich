TRANSLA TJONS.

Were thicker than itself with brother's blood?

Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens

To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?

And what's in prayer, but this twofold force,

To be forestalled ere we corne to fall,

Or pardoned, being down? Then I'll look up;
My fault is past. But O, what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!

That cannot be; since I am still possessed
Of those effeets sor which I did the murder,

My crown, mine own ambstion, and my queen.

SHAKESPEARE.
