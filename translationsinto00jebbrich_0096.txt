TRANSLA TIONS.

III.

My lyre Ι tune, my voice I mise,
And with my numbers mix my sighs ;
And whilst Ι sing Euphelia’s praise,

Ι fix my soul on Cloe’s eyes,

IV.

Fair Cloe blush’d: Euphelia frown'd:
I sung and gazed; Ι play’d and trembled:

And Venus to the Loves around

Remark’d how ill we all dissembled.

PRIOR.
