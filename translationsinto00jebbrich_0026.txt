10 TRANSLA TJONS.

Well‚ it is gone at last, the palace of music I reared;
’ Gone! and the good tears start, the praises that come
too slow;
For one is assured at first, one scarce can say that he feared,
That he even gave it a thought, the gone thing was to go.
Never to be again! But many more of the kind
As good, nay, better perchance : is this your comfort to me?
To me, who must be saved because I eling with my mind

To the same, same sels, same love, same God: ay, what

was, shall be.

Therefore to whom turn I but to Thee, the ineffable N ame?
Builder and maker‚ Thou, of houses not made with hands!
What, have sear of change from Thee who art ever the same ?
Doubt that Thy power can fill the heart that Thy power

expands?
There shall never be one lost good! What was, -shall live

as before ;
The evil is null, is nought, is silence implying sound ;
What was good, shall be good, with, for evil, so much
good more;

On the earth, the broken arcs3 in the heaven, a perfect

round.
