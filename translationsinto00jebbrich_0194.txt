1 7 8 TRA NSLA TJONS.

Crowded like waves upon me, but he was
A part of all ; and in the last he lay
Reposing from the noontide sultriness,
Couch'd among fallen columns, in the shade
Of ruin’d walls: where by his sleeping side
Stood camels grazing, and some goodly steeds
Were fastened near a fountain: and a man
Clad in a flowing garb did watch the while,
While many of his tribe slumbered around:
And they were canopied by the blue sky,
So cloudleSS‚ clear and purely beautiful,

That God alone was to be seen in Heaven.

LORD BYRON.
