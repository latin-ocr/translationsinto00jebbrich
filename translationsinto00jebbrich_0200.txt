No war or battle’s sound
Was heard the world around:
The idle spear and shield were high up hung;
The hooked chariot stood
Unstained with hostile blood;

The trumpet spake not to the armdd throng;

And kings sat still with awful eye,

As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.

But peaeeful was the night

Wherein the Prince of Light

His reign of peace upon the earth began:
The winds with wonder whist
Smoothly the waters kissed,

Whispering new joys to the mild ocean,

Who now hath quite forgot to rave,

While bIrds of calm sit brooding on the charmdd wave.
