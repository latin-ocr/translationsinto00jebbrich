194 TRANSLA TJONS.

For if such holy song
Enwrap our fancy long,

Time will run back and fetch the age of gold,
And speckled Vanity
Will sicken soon and die,

And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould,
And Hell itself will pass away,

And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.

Yea, Truth and Justice then
Will down return to men,
Orbed in a rainbow; and like glories wearing
Mercy will sit between,
Throned in celestial sheen,

With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering‚

And Hemren, as at some festival,

Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall.
