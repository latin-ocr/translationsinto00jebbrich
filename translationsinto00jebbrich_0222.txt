206 TRANSLA TIONS.

So when the sun in bed,
Curtained with cloudy red,

Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,

The flocking shadows pale
Troop to the infernal jail,

Each settered ghost slips to his several grave,
And the yellow-skirted says

Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze.

But see the Virgin blest

Hath laid her Babe to rest,

Time is our tedious song should here have ending.

Heaven's youngest-teemed star

Hath fixed her polished car,

Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending:

And all about the courtly stable

Bright-harnessed angels sit in order serviceable.

MILTON.
