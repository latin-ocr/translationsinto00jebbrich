DIAPHENIA like the daffadowndilly‚

White as the sun, fair as the lily,
Heigh ho, how I do love thee!

I do love thee as my lambs

Are beloved of their dams ;

How blest were I if thou would'st prove me

Diaphenia like the spreading roses,
That in thy sweet all sweets encloses,

Fair sweet‚ how Ι do love thee!

I do love thee as each flower
Loves the sun’s life-giving power;

For dead, thy breath to life might move me.
