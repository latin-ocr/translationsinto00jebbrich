Alas! for this gray shadow, once a man—
So glorious in his beauty and thy choice,
Who madest him thy chosen‚ that he seem’d
To his great heart none other than a God!
I ask’d thee, “Give me immortality.’'
Then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile,
Like wealthy men who care not how they give.
But thy strong Hours indignant work’d their wills,
And beat me down and marr'd and wasted me,
'And though they could not end me, left me maim'd
To dwell in presence of immortal youth,
Immortal age beside immortal youth,
And all I was, in ashes. Can thy love,
Thy beauty, make amends, though even now,
Close over us, the silver star, thy guide,
Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears
To hear me? Let me go: take back thy gift:
Why should a man desire in any way
To vary from the kindly race of men, ’

Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance
