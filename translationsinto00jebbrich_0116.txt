“Still strove to speak: my voice was thick with sighS,
“As in a dream. Dimly I could descry
“The Stern black-bearded kings with wolfish eyes

“Waiting to see me die.

“The high masts flickered as they lay afloat,
“ The crowds, the temples waver’d‚ and the shore;
“The bright death quivered at the victim's throat3

‘⁴ Touch’d; and I knew no more.”

TENNYSON.
