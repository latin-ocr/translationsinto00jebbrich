TRANSLA TIONS.

Or, What good love may I perform for you?
Many a poor man's son would have lain still
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
But you at your siek service had a prince.

N ay, you may think my love was crafty love,
And call it cunning; do, an if you will:

If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,

Why then you must.—Will you put out mine eyes?

These eyes that never did nor never shall

So much as frown on you?

I have sworn to do it,

And with hot irons must I burn them out.

SHAKESPEARE:
