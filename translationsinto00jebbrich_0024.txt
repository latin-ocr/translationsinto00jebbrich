All through my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of
my soul,
All through my soul that praised as its wish flowed
visibly forth,
All through music and me ! For think, had I painted the whole,
Why, there it had stood, to see, nor the process so won-
der-worth :
Had I written the same, made verse—still, effect proceeds
from cause,
Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told3
It is all triumphant art, but art in obedience to laws,

Painter and poet are proud in the artist-list enrolled :—

But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,
Existent behind all laws, that made them and, lo, they are!

And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,
That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound,

but a star.

Consider it well: each tone of our scale in itself is nought;
It is everywhere in the world—loud‚ soft, and all is said:

Give it to me to use! I mix it with two in my thought

And, there! Ye have heard and seen: consider and bow -
the head!
