But wisest F ate says n0,
This m-ust not yet be so‚'

The Babe lies yet in smiling infancy,
That en the bitter cross

Must redeem our loss

So both Himself and us to glorify:

Yet first to those ychained in sleep

The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,

With such a horrid clang
As on Mount Sinai rang,
While the red fire and smouldering clouds out brake:
The aged earth aghast,
With terror of that blast,
Shall from the surface to the centre shake3

When at the world's last session

⁴The dreadful Judge in middle air >shall spread His throne.
