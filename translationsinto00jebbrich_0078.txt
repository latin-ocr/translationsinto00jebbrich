§62 TRANSLA TIONS.

DARKNESS.

Ι had a dream, which was not all a dream.

The bright sun was extinguished‚ and thestars

Did wander darkling in the eternal space,

Rayless and pathless‚ and the icy earth

Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;

Morn carne and went—and came, and brought no day.

The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still,

And nothing stirred within their silent depths;

Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,
