TRANSLA TIONS.

Dost thou look back· ?

DOST thou look back on what hath been,
As some divinely—gifted man,
Whose life in low estate began

And on a simple village green;

Who breaks his birth's invidious bar,
And grasps the skirts of happy chance,
And breasts the blows of circumstance,

And grapples with his evil star:

Who makes by force his merit known,
And lives to clutch the golden keys,
To mould a mighty state's decrees,

And shape the whisper of the throne:
