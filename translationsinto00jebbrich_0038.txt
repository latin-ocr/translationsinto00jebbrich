22 TRANSLA TJONS.

In days far off, and with what other eyes
I used to watehv-if Ι be he that watch'd—
The lucid outline forming round thee; saw

The dim curls kindle into sunny rings ;

Changed with thy mystic change, and felt my blood
Glow with the glow that slowly crimson'd all
Thy presence and thy portals‚ while I lay,
Mouth, forehead, eyelids‚ growing dewy—warm
With kisses balmier than half-opening buds
O'f April, and could hear the lips that kiss’d
Whispering I knew not what of wild. and sweet‚
Like* that strange song I heard Apollo sing,
While Ilion like a mist rose into towers.

Yet hold me not for ever in thine East:
How can my nature longer mix with thine?
Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, cold
Are all thy lights‚ and cold my wrinkled feet
Upon thy glimmering thresholds‚ when the steam
Floats up from those dim fieldsvabout the homes

Of happy men that have the power to die,
