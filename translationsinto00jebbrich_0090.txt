TRANSLA TIONS.

THE GENIUS OF THE Woon.

.Ι.

O'ER the smooth enamell’d green,
Where no print of foot hath been,
Follow me, as I sing
And touch the warbled string:
Under the shady roof
Of branching elm, star-proof,
Follow me:
I will bring you where she sits

Clad in splendour as befits
Her deity:

. Such a rural queen

All Arcadia hath not seen.
