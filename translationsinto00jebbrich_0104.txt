TRANSLA TJONS.

Ode.

AWAKE‚ Aeolian Lyre, awake!

And give to rapture all thy trembling strings;
From Helicon’s harmonious springs
A thousand rills their mazy progress take:
The laughing fiowers that round them blow
Drink life and fragrance as they flovv.
Now the rich stream of music winds along

Deep, majestic‚ smooth and strong,

Through verdant valesv and. Ceres' golden reign:
