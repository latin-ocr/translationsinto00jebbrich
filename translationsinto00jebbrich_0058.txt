No, no—I will not say it-I will go!

Father‚ I choose! I will not ‘take a heaven
Haunted by shrieks of far-off misery.

This deed and I have ripened with the hours:
It is a part of me-a wakened thought

That, rising like a giam, masters me,

And grows into a doom. O mother life,

That seemed to nourish me so tenderly‚

Even in the womb you vowed me to the fire,
Hung on my soul the burden of men's hopes,
And pledged me to redeem.—I’ll pay the debt!
You gave me strength that I should pour it all
