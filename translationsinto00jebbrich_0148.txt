132 TRANSLA TIONS.

From ‘ E noch A rden.’

Am, these he saw; but what he fain had seen
He could not see, the kindly human face,

Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard

The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowL

The league-long roller thundering on the reef,
The moving whisper of huge trees that branch’d
And blossom’d in the zenith, or the sweep

Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave‚
