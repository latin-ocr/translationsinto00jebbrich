TRANSLA TJONS.

And their masts fell down piece-meal: as they dropp’d

They slept on the abyss without a surge——

The waves were dead: the tides were in their grave,
The moon, their mistress, had expired before;

The winds were wither’d in the stagnant air,

And the clouds perish’d! Darkness had no need

Of aid from them—She was the Universe.

LORD BYRON.
