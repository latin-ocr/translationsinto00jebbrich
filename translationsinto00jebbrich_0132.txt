116 TRANSLA TJONS.

Their smooth tops shining sunwards, and beneath
Burying their unsunned stems in grass and flowers:
Where in one dream the feverish time of Youth
Might fade in slumber, and the feet of Joy

Might wander all day long and never tire:

Here carne the king, holding high feast, at morn,
Rose-crowned ; and ever, when the sun went down,
A hundred lamps beamed in the tranquil gloom,
From tree to tree, all through the twinkling grove

Revealing all the tumult of the feast,
While the deep—burnished foliage overhead
Splintered the silver arrows of the moon.

MATTHEW ARNOLD.
