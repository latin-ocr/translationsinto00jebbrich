202 TRANSLA TJONS.

Peor and Baalim
Forsake their temples dim,
With that twice battered god of Palestine;

And mooned Ashtaroth,

Heaven's queen and mother both,
Now sits not girt with taper’s holy shine;
The Lybie Hammon shrinks his horn,

In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.

And sullen Moloch fled
Hath left in shadows. dread

His burning idol all of blackest hue;
In vain with cymbals’ ring
They call the grisly king,

In dismal dance about the furnace blue;
The brutish gods of Nile as fast,

Isis, and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste.
