210 TRANSLA TIONS.

The Rainbow comes and goes,
And lovely is the Rose,
The Moon doth with delight
Look round her when the heavens are bare,

Waters on a starry night
Are beautiful and fair;

The sunshine is a glori0us birth;

But yet I know, where’er Ι go,

That there hath past away a glory from the earth.

Now while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
And while the young lambs bound
As to the tabor’s sound‚
To me alone there came a thought of grief:
A timely utterance gave that thought relies,
And I again am strong:
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;

No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;

I hear the 'Echoes through the mountains throng‚
The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
