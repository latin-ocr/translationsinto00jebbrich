TRANSLA T'JONS.

But with a sweet forgetting
They stay their crystal fretting,
Never, never petting

About the frozen time.

Ah! would 'twere so with many
A gentle girl and boy!

But were there eVer any
Writhed not at passed joy?

To know the change and feel it,
When there is none to heal it,
Nor numbed sense to steal itâ€”

Was never said *in rhyme.

KEATS.
