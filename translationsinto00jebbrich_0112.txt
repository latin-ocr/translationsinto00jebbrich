TRANSLA TIONS.

D) a Lady's Gz‘m'le.

THAT which her slender waist confined
Shall now my joyful temples bind:
No monarch but would give his crown

His arms might do what this has done.

It was my heaven’s extremest sphere
The pale which held that lovely deer:
My joy, my grief, my hope, my love

Did all within this circle move.

A narrow compass! And yet there

Dwelt all that's good and all that’s fair;
Give me but what this riband bound—

Take all the rest the sun goes round.

WALLER.
