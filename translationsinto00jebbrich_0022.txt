6 TRANSLA TJONS.

I'n sight? Not half! for it seemed‚ it was certain, to match
man's birth,
Nature in turn conceived‚ obeying an impulse as I;
And the emulous heaven yearned down, made effort to
, reach the earth,
As the earth had done her best, in my passion, to scale
the sky:
N ovel splendours burst forth, grew familiar and dwelt with mine,
Not a point nor peak but found and fixed its wandering star;
Meteor—moons, balls of blaze: and they did not pale nor plne,
For earth had attained to heaven, there was no more
near nor far.

Nay more; for there wanted not who walked in the glare
and glow,
Presences plain in the place; or, fresh from the Protoplast‚
Furnished for ages to come, when a kindlier wind should blow,
Lured now to begin and live, in a house to their liking at last ;
Or else the wonderful Dead who have passed through the
body and gone,
But were back once more to breathe in an old world
worth their new:
What never had been, was now; what was, as it shall be anon;

And what iS,—shall I say, matched both? for I was γ
made perfect too.
