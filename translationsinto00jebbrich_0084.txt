68

TRANSLA TJONS.

One on earth in silence wrought‚
And his grave in silence sought:
But the younger, brighter form

Passed in battle and in storm.

So, whene’er Ι turn my eye
Back upon the days gone by,
Saddening thoughts of friends come o'er me,—

Friends who closed their course before me.

Yet what binds us friend to friend
But that soul with soul can blend?
Soul-like were those hours of yore—

Let us walk in soul once more!

Take‚ O boatman, thrice.thy see——
Take, I give it willingly;
For, invisible to thee,

Spirits twain have crossed with me.

LONGFELLOW.
