TRANSLA TJONS. ’

Have gat them glory and given of their own praise
To the earth that bare them and the day that bred,
Home friends and far-off hospitalities‚

And filled with gracious and memorial farne

Lands loved of summer or washed by violent seas,
Towns populous and many unfooted ways,

And alien lips, and native with their own.

But when white age and venerable death

Mow down the strength and life within their limbs,
Drain out the blood and darken their clear eyes,
Immortal honour is on them, having past

Through splendid life and death desirable

To the clear seat and remote throne of souls‚
Lands undiscoverable in the unheard-of west,
Round which the strong stream of a sacred sea
Rolls without wind for ever, and the snow

There shows not her white wings and windy feet,
Nor thu-fider nor swift rain saith anything,

Nor the sun burns, but all things rest and thrive.

SWINBURNE.
