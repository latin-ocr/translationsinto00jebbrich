TRANSLA TJONS.

Now rolling down the steep amain
Headlong, impetuous‚ see it pour;
The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar.
Ο sovereign of the willing. soul,
Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs,
Enchanting Shell! the sullen Cares
And frantie Passions hear thy soft control.
On Thracia's hills the Lord of War
Has curb’d the fury of his car,
And dropt his thirsty lance at thy command:
Perching: on the sceptred hand

Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feather’d king
With ruffled plumes and flagging wing:

Quenched in dark clouds of slumber lie

The terror of his beak and lightnings of his eye.

GRAY.
