TRANSLA TJONS.

Into this anguish. I can never shrink

Back into bliss—my heart has grown too big

With things that might be. Father, I will go.

O Father, will the women of our tribe

Suffer as I do in the years to come

When you have made them great in Africa?

Redeemed from ignorant ills only to feel

A conscious woe? Then—is it worth the pains?

Were it not better when we reach that shore

To raise a funeral pile and perish all?

So cIOSIng up a myriad avenues

To misery yet unwrought? My soul is faint—

Will these sharp pains buy any certain good?
Zarca. N ay, never salter: no great deed is done

By falterers who wish for certainty.

No good is certain, but the steadfast mind,

The undivided will to seek the good:

The greatest gift the hero leaves his race,

Is to have been a hero.

GEORGE Euo-r.
