PR1NCE ARTHUR. HUBERT.

A. HAVE you the heart? When your head did but acho,
I knit my handkerehief about your brows,
(The best I had, a princess wrought it me,)
And I did never ask it you again :1 ·
And with my hand at midnight held your head;
And, like the watchful m'inutes to the hour,

Stil] and anon choered up the heavy time3

Saying, What lack you? and, VVhere lies your grief?
