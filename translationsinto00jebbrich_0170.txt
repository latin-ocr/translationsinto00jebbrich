TRANSLA TIONS.

ROMEO.

O MY love! my wife!
Death‚ that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer’d ; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks‚
And death’s pale flag is not advanced there. ’
Tybalt, liestthou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain

To sunder his that was thine enemy?
