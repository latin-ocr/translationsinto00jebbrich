TRANSLA TIONS.

Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery:
The sun's a thies, and with his great attraction
Robs the vast sea: the moon’s an arrant thies,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
The sea‘s a thies, whose liquid surge resolves
The moon into salt tears: the earth’s a thies,
That feeds and 'breeds by a composture stolen
From general excrement; each thing's a thief3

The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power

‚H ave uncheek'd theft.

SHAKESPEARE.
