DOROTHEA.

THOU fool!
That gloriest in having power to ravish
A trifle from me Ι am weary of :
What is this life to me? not worth a thought;
Or, if it be esteemed, 'tis that I lose it
To win a better: even thy malice serves
To me but as a ladder to mount up
To such a height of happiness, where I shallv

Look down with scorn en thee and on the world;
