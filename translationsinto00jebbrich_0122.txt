106 TRANSLA TJONS.

The Praise of V z'rtue.

THE sturdy rock, for all his strength,
By raging seas is rent in twain;

The marble rock is pearsed at length
With little drops of drizzling rain;

The oxe doth yield unto the yoke,
The steele obeyeth the hammer’s stroke5

The ,stately stagge that seems so stoute

By yelping hounds at bay is set;
