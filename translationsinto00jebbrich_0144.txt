1⁴28 TRANSLA TJONS.

The Sun’s eye had a sickly glare,

The Earth with age was wan,
The skeletons of nations' were

Around that lonely man!
Some had expired in fight‚—-the brands
Still rusted in their bony hands;

In plague and famine some!
Earth’s cities had no sound nor tread;
And ships were drifting with the dead

To shores where all was dumb!

Yet prophet-like that lone one stood

With dauntless words and high,

That shook the sere leaves from the wood
As if a storm passed by,

Saying, We are twins in death, proud Sun,

Thy face is cold‚ thy race is run,
