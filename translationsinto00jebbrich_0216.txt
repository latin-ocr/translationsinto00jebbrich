200 ξ TRA NSLA TJONS.

The lonely mountains o’er
‘And the resounding shore

A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;
From haunted spring and dale
Edged with poplar pale

The parting genius is with sighing sent;
With flower-inwoven tresses torn

The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.

In consecrated earth
And on the holy hearth

The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint;
In urns and altars round

A drear and dying sound

Affrights the Flamens at their‘service quaint;
And the chill marble seems to sweat,

While each peculiar power foregoes his Wonted seat.
