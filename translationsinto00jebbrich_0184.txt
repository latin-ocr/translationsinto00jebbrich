ARTHUR.

YET think not that I come to urge thy crimes;
Ι did not come to curse thee, Guinevere,

1, whose vast pity almost makes me die ,
To see thee laying there thy golden head,

My pride in happier summers, at my feet.

The wrath which forced my thoughts on that fierce law,

‘The doom of treason and the flaming death,

(When first Ι learnt thee hidden' here) is past.
