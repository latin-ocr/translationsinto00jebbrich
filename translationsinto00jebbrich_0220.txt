204 TRANSLA TIONS.

Nor is Osiris seen
In Memphian grove or green,
Trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud:
Nor can he be at rest
Within his sacred chest‚
Nought but profoundest hell can be his shroud;
In vain with timbrelled anthems dark

The sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark.

He feels from Juda's land
The dreaded Infant's hand⁷

The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;
Nor all the gods beside
Longer dare abide,

Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:
Our Babe, to show His Godhead true,

Can in His swaddling bands control the damned crew.
