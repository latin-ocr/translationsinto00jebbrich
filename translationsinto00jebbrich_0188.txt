T he Dead.

HE who hath bent him o'er the dead

Ere the first day of death is fied,

The first dark day of nothingness,

The last of danger and distress‚

(Before Decay’s effacing fingers

Hath swept the lines where beauty lingers‚)
And marked the mild angelic air,

The rapture of repose that’s there,
