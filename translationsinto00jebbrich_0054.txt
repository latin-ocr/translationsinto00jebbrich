TRANSLA TIONS.

Sz'lence.

THEY seem'd to those who saw them meet
The worldly friends of every day:

Her smile was undisturbed and sweet,

His courtesy was free and gay:

But yet, if one the other’s name

In some unguarded moment heard,

The heart you thought so calm and tame,
Would struggle like a captur'd bird;

And letters of mere formal phrase

Were blister’d with repeated tearS.
