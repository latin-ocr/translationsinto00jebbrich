198 TRANSLA TJONS.

And then at last our bliss
Full and perfect is,

But now begin53 for, from this happy day,
The old dragon, underground

In straiter limits bound,

Not half so far casts his usurped sway,
And, wroth to see his kingdom fail,

Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tajl.

The oracles are dumh,
No voice or hideous hum

Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.
Apollo from his shrine
Can no h10re divine,

With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.
No nightly tranee, or breathed speH,

Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetie cell.
