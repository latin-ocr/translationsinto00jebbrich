108 TRANSLA TJONS.

The swiftest bird that flies about
Is caught at length in fowler’s net;

The greatest fish in deepest brooke

Is soon deceived by subtle hooke;
Yea, man himself, unto whose will

All things are bounden to obey,
For all his wit and worthie skill,

Doth fall at last and fade away.
There is no thing but time doeth waste;

The heavens, the earth consume at last.
But Vertue sits triumphing still

Upon her throne of glorious fame:
Though spiteful death must body kilI,

Yet hurts he not his vertuous fame,
But life or death, whatso betides

The state of Vertue never slides.

MARSHALL.
