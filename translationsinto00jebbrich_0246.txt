2 30 ΤΚΛ NSLA TJONS.

To live beneath your more habitual sway.
I love the Brooks which down their channels fret,

Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;
The innocent brightness of a new-born Day

Is lovely yet;
The Clouds that gather round the setting sun
Do take a sober colouring from an eye
That hath kept watch o’er man's mortality;
Another race hath been, and other palms are won.
Thanks to the human heart by which we live,

Thanks to its tenderness‚ its joys, and sears,

To· me the meanest flower that blows can give
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tearS.

WORDSWORTH.
