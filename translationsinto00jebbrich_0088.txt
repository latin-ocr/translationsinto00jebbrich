TRANSLA TJONS.

Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
I have not known when his affections sway'd

More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,

Whereto the climber upward turns his face:

But when he once attains the upmost round,

He then unto the ladder turns his back,

Looks in the cloudS‚ scorning the base degrees

By which he did ascend. So Caesar may3

Then, lest he may, prevent.

SHAKESPEARE.
