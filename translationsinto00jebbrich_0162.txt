TRANSLA TJONS.

Till this were told.” And saying this the seer
Went thro’ the strait and dreadful pass of death,
Not ever to be question'd any more

Save on the further side; but when I met
Merlin, and ask’d him if these things were truth—
The shining draan and the naked child
Descending in the glory of the seas—

He laugh'd as is his wont, and answer’d me

In riddling triplets of old time, and said:

“Rain‚ rain, and sun! a rainbow on the lea!
And truth is this to me, and that to thee ;
And truth or clothed or naked let it be.

Rain, sun, and rain! and the free blossom blows;
Sun‚ rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?

From the great deep to the grth deep he goeS.''

TENNYSON.
