TRANSLA TJONS.

And this was not the work of days,
But had gone on for years and years.

Alas, that Love was not too strong
For maiden shame and manly pride!

Alas, that they delay'd so long
The goal of mutual bliss beside!

Yet, what no chance could then reveaL

And neither would be first to own,
Let fate and courage now conceal,
When truth could bring remorse alone.

LORD HoUGHTON.
