TRANSLA TJONS.

ALTHAEA.

BUT thou, son, be not filled with evil dreams

Nor with desire of these things; for with time
Blind love burns out; but if one seed it full

Till some discolouring stain dyes all his life,

He shall keep nothing praiseworthy, nor die

The sweet wise death ⁴of old men honourable,

Who have lived out all the length of all their years
Blameless‚ and seen well-pleased the face of gods,
And without shame and without sear have wrought
Things memorable, and while their days held out

in sight of all men and the sun's great light
