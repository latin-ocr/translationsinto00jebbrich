TRANSLA TIONS.

Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet‚

Why art thou yet so fair? shall Ι believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,

And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For sear of that, I still will stay with thee:
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids ; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,

And shake the yoke of inauspicious'stars

From this world-wearied flesh.

SHAKESPEARE.
