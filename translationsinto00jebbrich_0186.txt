170 ’. TRANSLA TJONS.

The paug—which while I weigh’d thy heart with one
Too wholly true to dream untruth in thee,

Made my tears burn—is also past, in part.

And 311 ἰ5 past, the sin is sinn’d, and I,

Lo! I forgive thee, 35 Eternal God

Forgives: do thou for thine own soul the rest.

But how to take last leave of all I loved?

O golden hair, with which Ι used to play

Not knowIng! O imperial moulded form,

And beauty such 35 never woman wore,

Until it came 3 kingdom’s curse with thee—

Ι cannot touch thy lips, they are not mine,

But Lancelot’s: nay, ‘they never were the king's.·

TENNYSON.
