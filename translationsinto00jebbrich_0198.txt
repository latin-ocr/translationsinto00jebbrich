182 TRANSLA TIONS.

Only with speeches fair
She woos the gentle air
To hide her guilty front with innocent SnOW,
And on her naked shame,
Pollute with sinful blame,

The saintly veil of maiden white to thr0w‚

Ι Confounded, that her Maker’s eyes

Should look so near upon her foul deformities.

But He, her fears to cease,
Sent down the meek-eyed Peace;
She, crowned with olive green, came softly sliding
Down through the turning sphere
His ready harbinger,

With turtle Wing the amorous clouds dividing,

And waving wide her myrtle wand,

She strikes an universal peace through sea and land.
