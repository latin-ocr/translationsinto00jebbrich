SATAN.

WHAT though the field be lost?
All is not lost; the unconquerable will,
And study of revenge, immortal hate,
And courage never to submit or yield‚
And what else is not to be overcomez—

That glory never shall his Wrath or might

Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace

With suppliant knee, and deisy his power
