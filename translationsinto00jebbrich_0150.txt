As down the shore he ranged, or all day long

Sat often in the seaward gazing gorge,

A shipwreck'd sailor, waiting for a sail:

No sail from day to day, but every day

The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts

Among the palms and ferns and precipices;

The blaze upon the waters to the east;

The blaze upon the island overhead;

The blaze upon the waters to the west3

Then the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven,

The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again
The scarlet shafts of sunrise, but no sail.

TENNYSON.
