TRANSLA TJONS.

On An Early Deatlz.

A PEARLY dew-drop see some flower adorn
And grace with tender beam the rising morn;
But soon the sun permits a fiercer ray,

And the fair fabric rushes to decay.

Lo, in the dust the beauteous ruin lies;

And the pure vapour seeks its native skies.

A fate like this to thee, sweet boy, was given—-
To sparkle, bloom and be exhaled to heaven.

LORD BYRON.
