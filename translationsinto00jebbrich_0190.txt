The fix'd yet tender traits that streak

The languor of the placid cheek,

and-but stn·that sad shrouded eye,
That fires not, wins not, weeps not now,
And but for that chill, changeless brow,

Where cold obstruction’s apathy

Appals the gazing mourner's heart.

As if to him it could impart

The doom he dread5‚ yet dwells upon;

YeS‚ but for these and these alone,

Some moments, ay, one treacherous hour,

He still might doubt the tyrant's power;

,So fair, so ealm, so softly sean,

The first, last look by death reveal'd!

Suebis the aspect of this shore,

’Tis Greece, but living Greece no more!

LORD BYRON. s
