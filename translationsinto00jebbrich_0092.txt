TRANSLA TJONS.

II.

Nymphs and Shepherds, dance no more

By sandy Ladon‘s lilied bankS,
On old Lycaeus or Cyllene hoar

Trip no more in twilight ranks:
Though Erymanth your loss deplore

A better soil shall give ye thanks.

From the stony Maenalus
Bring your flocks and live with us:

Here ye shall have greater grace

To serve the lady of this place;
Though Syrinx your Pan’s mistress were,
Yet Syrinx well might wait on her:
Such a rural queen
All Arcadia hath not seen.

MILToN.
