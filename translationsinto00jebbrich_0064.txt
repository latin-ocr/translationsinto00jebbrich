TRANSLA TIONS.

And moving up from high to higher,-
Becomes on Fortune's crowning slope
The pillar of a people’s hope,

The centre of a world’s desire;

Yet feels as in a pensive dream,
When all his active powers are still,
A distant dearness in the hill,

A secret sweetness in the stream,

The limit of his narrower fate,
While yet beside its vocal springs
He play'd at counsellors and kings,

With one that was his earliest mate;

Who ploughs with toil his native lea,
And reaps the labour of his hands,
Or ‘in the furrow musing stands;

‘Does my old friend remember me ?'
