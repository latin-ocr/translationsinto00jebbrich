84 TRANSLA TJONS.

The human form, till marble grew divine,

And mothers‚ gazing‚ drank the love men see
Reflected in their race, behold, and perish.

He told the hidden power of herbs and springs,

And Disease drank and slept. Death grew like Sleep.
He taught the implicnted orbits woven

Of the wide-wandering stars; and how the sun
Changes his lair, and by what secret spell

The pale moon is transform’d, when her broad eye
Gazes not on the interlunar sea.

He taught to mle, as life directs the limbs,

The tempest-winged chariots of the ocean,

And the Celt knew the Indian. Cities then

Were built, and through their snow-white columns flow’d
The warm winds‚ and the azure aether shone,

And the blue sea and shadowy hills were seen.
Such, the alleviations of his state,

Prometheus gave to mam for which he hangs
Withering in destin'd pain,

SHELLEY.
