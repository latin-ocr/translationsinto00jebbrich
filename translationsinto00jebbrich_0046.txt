Peace, cousin, say no more!
And now I will unclasp a secret book,
And to your quick-conceiving discontents
I’ll read you matter deep and dangerous,
As full of peril and adventurous spirit
As to o'er-walk a curljent roaring loud
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:

Send danger from the east unto the west,
