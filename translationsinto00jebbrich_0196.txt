HYMN

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ MORNING OF CHRIST‘S NATIVITY.

IT was the winter wild,
While the Heaven—born Child

All meanly wrapped in the rude manger lies:
Nature in awe to Him
Had doffed her gaudy trim,

With her great Master so to sympathize:

It was no season then for her

To wanton with the sun, her lusty paramour.
